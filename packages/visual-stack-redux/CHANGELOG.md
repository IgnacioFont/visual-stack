# 0.0.5 (March 28, 2016)

## Other Changes

- Made the version constraint on visual-stack considerably more relaxed. Until the API stabilizes, it is the responsibility of client packages to provide a reasonable version of visual-stack.

# 0.0.3 (March 24, 2016)

## Bugfixes

- Fix the `MenuBarDropdown` behavior to properly close the dropdown after a second click anywhere on the page, even on the menu bar button itself, which should serve as a toggle.

# 0.0.2 (March 23, 2016)

## Bugfixes

- The `MenuBar` and `MenuBarDropdown` components now have properly-listed `propTypes` and `contextTypes`.
